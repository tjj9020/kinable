# Compliance Backlog and Tracking

This document tracks requirements and progress related to various compliance standards and regulations relevant to the Kinable application.

## 1. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

**Goal**: Ensure the application handles children's data in accordance with COPPA requirements, particularly for users under 13 in the United States.

**Key Areas & Requirements**:
*   [ ] **Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC)**:
    *   Mechanism for obtaining VPC before collecting PII from children.
    *   Clear notice to parents about data collection practices.
*   [ ] **Data Minimization**: Only collect PII necessary for the child's participation.
*   [ ] **Parental Rights**: Provide parents with the ability to:
    *   Review their child's PII.
    *   Direct the deletion of their child's PII.
    *   Refuse further collection or use of their child's PII.
*   [ ] **Data Security**: Implement reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's PII.
*   [ ] **Data Retention & Deletion**: Define and implement policies for retaining and deleting children's PII.

**Current Status & Action Items**:
*   Phase X, Step Y: Task related to COPPA...

## 2. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

**Goal**: Ensure the application adheres to GDPR principles for users in the European Union.

**Key Areas & Requirements**:
*   [ ] **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Clear privacy notices, lawful basis for processing.
*   [ ] **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data.
*   [ ] **Accuracy**: Ensure data is accurate and up-to-date.
*   [ ] **Storage Limitation**: Keep data only as long as necessary.
*   [ ] **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Secure data processing.
*   [ ] **Accountability**: Demonstrate compliance.
*   [ ] **User Rights**: Support rights such as:
    *   Right of access.
    *   Right to rectification.
    *   Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten").
    *   Right to restrict processing.
    *   Right to data portability.
    *   Right to object.
*   [ ] **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)**: For high-risk processing.
*   [ ] **Data Breach Notification**.

**Current Status & Action Items**:
*   Phase X, Step Y: Task related to GDPR...

## 3. SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) - Lite/Aspiration

**Goal**: Align with SOC 2 trust service principles (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy) as an aspirational goal, potentially focusing on Security and Availability initially.

**Key Trust Service Principles & Considerations**:

### Security
*   [ ] **Access Controls**: Logical and physical access controls.
*   [ ] **Network Security**: Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention.
*   [ ] **Change Management**: Documented and approved changes.
*   [ ] **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and remediation.
*   [ ] **Security Incident Response**.

### Availability
*   [ ] **System Monitoring**: Performance and availability monitoring.
*   [ ] **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**: Plans and testing.
*   [ ] **Redundancy**: For critical components.

### Confidentiality
*   [ ] **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit.
*   [ ] **Access Controls**: For confidential information.
*   [ ] **Data Handling Policies**.

### Processing Integrity
*   [ ] **Data Validation**: Ensuring data is processed accurately.
*   [ ] **Error Handling**: Detecting and managing processing errors.

### Privacy (overlaps significantly with GDPR/COPPA)
*   [ ] **Notice and Consent**: Clear communication about privacy practices.
*   [ ] **Collection Limitation**: Collect only necessary PII.
*   [ ] **Use, Retention, and Disposal**: Defined policies.
*   [ ] **Access**: Users can access and review their PII.

**Current Status & Action Items**:
*   Phase X, Step Y: Task related to SOC 2 Security...
*   Phase X, Step Y: Task related to SOC 2 Availability...
