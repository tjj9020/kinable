Here is a **scalable, secure, and maintainable technical implementation plan** for the foundation of your family-safe, token-based AI chat app. This includes core services, billing, moderation, and a parent-facing dashboard — all designed with **production-readiness, low maintenance, and extensibility** in mind.

---

## **Core Components to Build**

### 1. **Lambda Authorizer (Security First)**

* Verifies JWT from Cognito
* Loads:

  * `familyId`
  * `profileId`
  * `role` (guardian | child)
  * `pause_status`
  * token balance (from DynamoDB)
* Denies requests if:

  * token balance exhausted
  * user is paused
  * JWT invalid or expired

**Security:**

* Short TTL (15 min) Cognito tokens
* Strict IAM role: Lambda can only read `Profiles` and `Families` scoped by `familyId`
* Token and access logging with CloudWatch and X-Ray

---

### 2. **Chat Router Lambda**

* Receives prompt and metadata (e.g., profile age)
* Selects model using routing matrix:

  * GPT-4o for parents and high-quality tasks
  * Claude Sonnet for teens and Explain-It
  * Bedrock Claude for long-form planning
* Proxies request to selected model (secure keys in Secrets Manager)
* Measures `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`

**Maintainability:**

* Models and routing logic defined in external JSON config
* New models added via config, not code rewrite
* AI provider keys pulled securely with IAM-limited access to Secrets Manager

---

### 3. **Moderation Engine Lambda**

* Called before and after AI response
* Uses:

  * OpenAI `/moderations` endpoint (free)
  * Custom age-based rule engine
* If blocked:

  * Returns filtered content
  * Stores event in `ModerationLog` table (DynamoDB)
* Optional: GPT-4o-mini rewriter if profanity detected

**Scalability:**

* Stateless, low-memory function
* Burstable for spikes
* Stream logs to S3 for audit and GDPR compliance

---

### 4. **Billing + Ledger Lambda**

* Token cost × billing multiplier = tokens to deduct
* Atomic update to DynamoDB:

```js
UpdateExpression: "SET tokensUsed = tokensUsed + :n",
ConditionExpression: "tokensUsed + :n <= :total"
```

* Fails if family has exhausted tokens
* On success:

  * Logs usage to `TokenLedger` table
  * Sends SNS alert if 90% threshold crossed

**Maintainability:**

* Token multipliers are config-driven
* Supports multiple providers and custom pricing
* Booster packs = simple `+tokens` to `extraBalance`

---

### 5. **Billing + Stripe Webhooks**

* Stripe checkout session for plans and booster packs
* Webhook flow:

```
Stripe → Webhook (Lambda)
       → Validate event (Stripe sig)
       → Update plan metadata in DynamoDB
       → Update token limits or +extraTokens
```

**Security:**

* Stripe signature verification
* Secure Lambda IAM permissions
* Logs into `BillingEvents` table (DynamoDB) for auditing

---

### 6. **Parent Dashboard (React + API Gateway)**

Features:

* View token usage per profile
* See full transcripts per child
* Pause / resume a profile
* Configure time limits / filters
* Purchase booster packs

**Security & Privacy:**

* Only `role=guardian` may access dashboard endpoints
* Profiles can only be read/written by `familyId` match
* PII in S3 is encrypted at rest (SSE-KMS)

---

## **Request–Response Flow**

### **Normal Chat Flow (500 tokens)**

1. Client sends `/chat` request with JWT + prompt
2. Lambda Authorizer checks:

   * Is JWT valid?
   * Is family paused or out of tokens?
   * Is this user allowed?
3. Moderation Lambda filters prompt (OpenAI + custom)
4. Router selects model → sends prompt
5. AI responds → output moderation runs
6. Billing Lambda:

   * Applies model multiplier (e.g., 0.72)
   * Deducts tokens
   * Logs to DynamoDB
7. Response returned to user

---

### **Stripe Webhook Flow (Booster Purchase)**

1. Stripe payment succeeds
2. Webhook received by billing-listener Lambda
3. Signature verified
4. Token count added to family’s `extraTokens`
5. Event logged to `BillingEvents`
6. Optional email/SNS “you’ve got more tokens!”

## **Security Model Summary**

| Area             | Control                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API access       | Cognito + custom JWT claims (`familyId`, `profileId`, `role`)       |
| Secrets          | AWS Secrets Manager with fine-grained IAM                           |
| Token tracking   | Atomic DynamoDB writes with conditional expressions                 |
| Audit logs       | Moderation + Billing logs written to S3 and DynamoDB                |
| GDPR             | “Forget Me” API purges user data from all stores via Step Functions |
| Model keys       | Never exposed to client, only used via secured proxy Lambdas        |
| Plan enforcement | Throttle + 402 responses if balance exhausted                       |

---

## **Why This Architecture Scales**

* **Serverless-first**: Auto-scales to 1K+ concurrent requests
* **Multi-model**: Supports GPT, Claude, Bedrock via routing matrix
* **Safe**: Moderation is enforced before and after all model output
* **Flexible**: Easy to add models, plans, routing logic via config files
* **Low Ops Burden**: Everything logs via CloudWatch, cost tracked via Budgets

---

Would you like:

* A SAM template to bootstrap this entire stack?
* OpenAPI 3.1 spec for the `/chat`, `/moderate`, `/ledger` endpoints?
* Stripe checkout + webhook integration template?

This is a rock-solid, low-maintenance foundation for what you're building.

Here’s a detailed **system prompt** you can use with your development AI agent (or repository README/internal onboarding tool) to proactively embed **multi-region readiness** into your architecture—even if launching in just one region. It also includes a blueprint for launching a **second region with failover support** later.

---

### **Prompt: Multi-Region Readiness and Future Failover Strategy**

---

**System Instruction to Development AI:**

You are designing a serverless AI-powered platform for family-safe chat, built on AWS using Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, and LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Perplexity.

Although the initial production deployment will run in **a single region (e.g., `us-east-1`)**, you must **architect the system to be multi-region ready** from the start.

### Multi-Region Readiness – Design Requirements

**1. Resource Naming Convention**
All resources must be region-aware:

```
<env>-<region>-<service>-<purpose> 
# e.g., chat-prod-us-east-1-users-table
```

**2. Regional Isolation by Design**

* **DynamoDB:** Tables are regional. Data must be partitioned by tenant/family and region (e.g., `PK = FAMILY#<region>#<familyId>`).
* **S3:** Use a region-local bucket per deployment (e.g., `chat-logs-eu-central-1`).
* **Verified Permissions (AVP):** Each region must use its own policy store. Define all Cedar policies as code and deploy them per region.

**3. Cognito Configuration**
Cognito is region-scoped. Do not hardcode identifiers; instead, parameterize Cognito pool IDs per region for future migration.

**4. API & Lambda Design**

* All services (API Gateway, Lambda) must be deployed via SAM or CDK with a region parameter.
* Use modular stacks so deployment to a new region is a CLI flag away.

**5. Routing Preparedness**
Although global routing will not be active at launch:

* Add a `region` field to user profiles and family tenant metadata.
* All logs, data storage, moderation, and token usage must stay local to that user’s pinned region.

**6. Observability Strategy**

* Logs and metrics must be local to each region.
* CloudWatch dashboards should be region-specific by default.
* Cross-region dashboards can be added later.

**7. Export & Delete Privacy Compliance**
Export and delete operations must read/write **only in the user’s region**. Never perform cross-region data joins.

---

### Launching a Second Region (Failover + Regional Expansion)

When ready to expand to a second region (e.g., `eu-central-1`):

**1. Deployment:**

* Duplicate the SAM stack and deploy to `eu-central-1`.
* Use a global feature flag or registration router (CloudFront + Lambda\@Edge or Route53) to send EU users to the EU region.

**2. Data Isolation:**

* Create new DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, AVP policy store, Cognito pool in the new region.
* No shared tables. All data is local.

**3. Model Routing:**

* Configure `ModelAdapter` per region (e.g., Gemini in EU, OpenAI in US).
* Add optional user override for advanced use cases.

**4. Failover Planning (future):**

* Use Route 53 Latency-Based or Failover routing to shift traffic if one region fails.
* Only fail over user **routing and chat requests**. Do not replicate sensitive data cross-region without consent.
* Optional: use EventBridge + S3 for soft replication of moderation labels for analytics-only use.

---

**DO NOT**:

* Share user chat data across regions
* Store multi-region logs together
* Hardcode any region-specific resource names

---

**Outcome:**
By following these instructions, your codebase and infrastructure will remain **single-region optimized at launch**, but will allow for **low-risk expansion** into new AWS regions or **failover deployment** if needed—all with no need to refactor core business logic, identity, or policy layers.

***Multi-region Readiness UpFront***
I want to achieve multi-region readiness with 1 click expansion down the road.  In order to do so we must enable global DynamoDB tables.  note that we will launch with us-east-2 as live and primary region
| Table                                     | Why Make Global                                                                                                         | Notes                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User & Family Metadata Table**          | 🟢 *CRITICAL* — Needed to identify users, resolve region, and authorize access in a failover                            | PK: `FAMILY#<region>#<family_id>`                                            |
| **Token Ledger Table**                    | 🟢 *CRITICAL* — Needed for continuity of usage quotas, billing, and alerts across regions                               | PK: `CHILD#<region>#<child_id>` + SK: `YYYY-MM-DD`                           |
| **Policy Configuration Table**            | 🟡 *Recommended* — So parents’ safety settings follow them during failover                                              | Only parent-writable; append-only version history helps reduce conflict risk |
| **Conversation Table (Short-Term)**       | 🟡 *Optional* — Replicate only the *last 10–20 messages* per thread for continuity. Full replication may be too costly. | If replicated, keep item size <500B; skip if you archive to S3               |
| **Family Knowledge Base (Shared Memory)** | 🟢 *Strongly Recommended* — Families expect their shared flashcards, notes, etc., to survive failover                   | Naturally append-only; low write volume; ideal for Global Tables             |

DO NOT USE GLOBAL TABLES FOR:
| Table                           | Why Not Global                                              | Alternative                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Moderation Event Logs**       | ❌ High volume + not needed cross-region                     | Store in S3 with cross-region replication     |
| **Audit/Token History Archive** | ❌ Write-heavy + immutable → S3 is cheaper and better suited | Archive periodically from DynamoDB or Kinesis |
| **Analytics / Aggregates**      | ❌ Calculated state should not be replicated                 | Use Athena or Redshift Spectrum from S3 logs  |

Design Considerations
| Best Practice                                        | Reason                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prefix all partition keys with `FAMILY#<region>#...` | Avoid cross-region collisions and make query routing clear |
| Use *single-writer per region* strategy              | Prevent "last write wins" conflicts                        |
| Keep **Global Table item sizes <400KB**              | Ensures faster replication and fewer retries               |
| Avoid transactional writes spanning regions          | Global Tables don’t support cross-region atomicity         |


### Legend:

* **API Gateway** handles all traffic, enforcing auth via Cognito.
* **ChatService** triggers moderation, routing, and logs all token use.
* **AVP** (Amazon Verified Permissions) enforces age, policy, and quota.
* **Router** selects the cheapest, safest LLM provider per request.
* **SNS/SES** send live alerts to the parent app for monitoring & control.
